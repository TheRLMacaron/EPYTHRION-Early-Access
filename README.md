# EPYTHRION-Early-Access
In this (very) colorful rage game (to the point where it hurts ur eyes), 
you play as BARRY; an older brother who always has to find his brother HARRY after all his goddamn shenanigans.
One day, an alien appears on earth and *CONVENIENTLY* places multiple
portals that send you to random places (aka completion orbs), right in front of harry outta **NOWHERE**
now you gotta find harry's dumb-ahh and also potentially stop the alien from conquering 
the damn planet with a whole crew of shape humanoids.
cool fact, the aliens' race is called Shapients.

warning: u wont be sane after like two specific levels

this game is only ported to windows so sorry linux users :v
