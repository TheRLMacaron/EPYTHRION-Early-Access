# EPYTHRION-Early-Access
in this (very)colorful rage game (to the point where it hurts ur eyes), 
u play as BARRY; an older brother who always has to find his brother HARRY after all his goddamn shenanigans.
one day, an alien appears on earth and CONVENIENTLY places multiple
portals that send u to random places (aka completion orbs), right in front of harry outta NOWHERE
now u gotta find harry's dumb ahh and also potentially stop the alien from conquering 
the damn planet with a whole crew of shape humanoids

warning: u wont be sane after like two specific levels
